At DC Maintenance, we strive to provide a superior level of cleaning that goes unnoticed, that is reliable, that is good for the work environment, and that meets the unique needs of every client. We believe in meeting or exceeding the expectations of our customers by supplying cleaning services that conform to their specified requirements, on time, every day. We strive to be respected and trusted by our clients as being responsive and innovative, while providing cleaning services with the best value.</p>      <p>Our cleaning technicians are hired only after a successful background check. This will ensure that when our cleaners enter your premises, you are leaving the cleaning to a trustworthy, dependable person. DC Maintenance' friendly cleaners are bonded and insured and will respond promptly to urgent as well as emergency requests.</p>       <p>Following the initial hiring process, our custodians undergo three extensive phases of training to ensure optimum on-the-job performance. We want to guarantee our clients that our cleaners are accurate, detailed and highly qualified.  Job training combined with safety training provides clients and employees with the safest possible working environment.</p>      <ul>         <li><b>Phase I</b>:  Cleaning members undergo a training session that involves a hands-on approach to learning how to clean using the standards set forth by DC Maintenance.  Team members receive instruction in effective cleaning techniques and safety procedures.</li>                 <li><b>Phase II</b>:  Cleaning members advance to a client location where they shadow an experienced DC Maintenance staff member. They are instructed as to        specific customer needs, safety requirements, and security procedures.</li>                 <li><b>Phase III</b>:   Cleaning members are periodically made abreast of the latest advances        in janitorial procedures and technologies.</li>      </ul>      <p>Eliminating dust is imperative to maintaining a clean and healthy home or office environment. That is why we use Green Seal approved vacuums, follow LEED guidelines, and use HEPA vacuums to help keep allergens to a minimum. A healthy environment is paramount in our cleaning program.</p>      <p>Our main goal is to protect the health of our customers and the environment, so that is why we choose to incorporate non-toxic germicidal and cleaning solutions in many of our cleaning and disinfecting procedures.</p>    </div>    <div class="column">      <img src="images/aboutusimg.jpg" style="width:100%">    </div>  </div></div></div></div><br><div class="divider"></div><!-- FOOTER --><div class="footer">    <div class="row2" align="center">        <div class="footercolumn">        <p style="font-size:13px"><a href="home.html">HOME</a></p>        <p style="font-size:13px"><a href="services.html">SERVICES</a></p>        <p style="font-size:13px"><a href="contact.html">CONTACT</a></p><p style="font-size:8px">DC Maintenance Service Â© 2018.<p>            <img id="footerlogo" src="images/logo2.png">      </div>    </div></footer></div><!-- JAVASCRIPT --><script>function myFunction() {    var x = document.getElementById("myTopnav");    if (x.className === "topnav") {        x.className += " responsive2";    } else {        x.className = "topnav";    }}</script></body></html>
